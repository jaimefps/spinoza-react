All work is done on `app.js`.
Other components made at a later time when the webpage becomes richer in content.

*MVP:*

1:: implement get-connection

*EXTRA FEATURES:*

1:: Node shape dependant on type (axiom, proposition, definition, etc)

2:: instructions shadow-box

3:: credits, inpirations, etc.

4:: display message when no connection or data is applicable to query

5:: get descendants and ancestors by degrees of separation 

6:: colorize the nodes given as input so as to distinguish them from the rest.
